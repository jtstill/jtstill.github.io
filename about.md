<h4 class="archive__subtitle">About Me</h4>
My LinkedIn page will tell you that I am a recent graduate of Loyola University Maryland looking to make a difference in the statistical and data analysis world. With a love of coding and enthusiasm for data manipulation and visualization, you'll often find me poring over some pet project or obsessing over a graph or chart. I'm always looking to apply the technical skills I've learned in school or at my job working from Capital Blue Cross in Harrisburg, PA -- SQL, Power BI, Python, RStudio, statistical modeling -- toward anything I can get my hands on. I've had the chance to study machine learning with Loyola's computer science department, research health equity and member demographics at Capital, and learn as much as I can about some cool and interesting topics in the realm of statistics, computer science, and healthcare.

On a personal note, I'd hope I'm not easily boxed into any one area. I'm a Navy brat. Both my parents served -- my mom as a doctor and my dad as a pilot -- and so my sister and I moved around a lot as a kid and got an appreciation for new places. I love geography and maps -- I think watching the results come in during the 2012 presidential election was probably the spark of that, although I don't think I knew it at the time. Statistical polling, political maps, demographics... that kind of stuff is always an interest of mine. 

2012 also featured the London Olympics, where David Boudia narrowly won gold on 10 meter platform. I thought the flips were pretty cool, so in high school I took up diving and was lucky enough to take that to college, where I competed on Loyola's swimming and diving team (roll Hounds!) and got to learn all sorts of cool and exciting dives, as well as make some great friends. I also ran track (high jump and pole vault) and cross country in high school, but unfortunately wasn't all that great (although I did manage to jump my own height)! I still have a love for the sport, though, and keep up with all the international competition results. Maybe what pulled me to these sports was that both diving and track are easily quantified -- whether through degrees of difficulty and execution scores or times, splits, and distances -- or maybe it was the idea that my performance in a competition was so dependent on my own effort, focus, and motivation. I like that aspect of self-determination.

On my nerdier side, I like collecting old coins -- I'm not sure if my favorite is my 1914-S $10 Indian Head eagle, my 1901 $5 Liberty Head half eagle, or my 1831 capped bust half dollar, all bought with money saved during summer jobs. I'm a big fan of Rubik's cubes, often fidgeting with one while I work (my fastest solves are in the 20-25 second range!). And I do quite like Star Wars (Revenge of the Sith, Clone Wars S7, and Rogue One/Andor being my favorites). 

I was one of the lucky ones when it came to dating, meeting my current fianc√©e in middle school. We dated all through high school and college, and finally tied the knot in November 2024 after eight and a half years. We love our quiet life so far in central PA!

Not sure if anything else rises to meet the occasion of an "About Me" section, but check out my [pet projects](/petprojects) to see what else interests me!
