# Hi! I'm Jack Still.
*Hey: how many x do you think I've done/eaten/travelled/won over the course of my life?*

I'm sure we've all asked similar questions at some point or another (if not, you're boring). Some people keep track of the states they've been to. Some want to know how many miles they've driven. Others wonder how many games of solitaire they've played or whether they've broken even in the lottery over the span of their lives or *swear* that their partner is luckier than they at board games. I am *always* asking questions like this (sometimes to the exasperation of those around me -- sorry). For better or for worse, thanks to my college studies in statistics and computer science and job as a data analyst, I can actually answer some of them! 

I'm creating this website as a space to store those little curiosities and pet projects as well as (hopefully) showcase some of the skills I've built up over the past few years. Don't expect all of these to be polished or fully fleshed out -- it's easy to lose focus when the next question inevitably arises.

For what it's worth, here are links to my [pet projects](/petprojects) and my [professional write-ups](/professional)! Thanks for visiting!
