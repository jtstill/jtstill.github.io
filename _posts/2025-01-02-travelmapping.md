<!--[Back to Geography Pet Projects](/petprojects/geography)-->
Ever since my cross country trip from Phoenix, AZ to Carlisle, PA in August of 2022 (which sparked a separate [quest](/petprojects/route_marker_project/) to get a picture with every state's highway sign), I really wished I had a way to visualize the trip other than manually tracing lines on a map or using cheap apps that didn't show the details of our journey. Almost exactly a year later, I first came across Travelmapping and knew it was the perfect solution. 

Thanks to the dedicated work of road and travel enthusiasts, who painstakingly maintain a series of highway segments all over the world, I can track everything from interstates to state routes to scenic parkways and generate maps which display my travels. See some of those travel stats below!
