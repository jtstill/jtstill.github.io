Sometimes when I play games, I feel like the unluckiest player ever. Other times I feel on top of the world. In the summer of 2022, Lyndsey and I played a lot of Yahtzee, and I *swear* she was always so much luckier than I was! As a statistician at heart, I was curious if this was truly the case, or if my seeming lack of luck was just an internal bias.

Of course, this curiosity spread to other games we played as well. Below are some of those that I've kept track of, whether it's testing my luck in Yahtzee or seeing which one of us will make it to a million points in Cribbage first...
