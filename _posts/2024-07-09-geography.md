Geography has always been an interest of mine. I credit my love for statistics and data visualization to the 2012 presidential election, when 11-year old me stayed up much later than usual on election night not because I really had a whole lot of stake in the results, but rather because I loved to watch the counties and states fill in red and blue and see the analysts strategize over remaining swing states and electoral votes. 

Below are some ongoing projects I have that are related to geography:
