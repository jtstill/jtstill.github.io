At some point during the height of COVID in college, I found myself addicted to [GeoWizard](https://www.youtube.com/GeoWizard)'s YouTube channel. A charismatic British guy with a passion for adventure, he produced content about straight-line missions (travelling the span of an entire country in a completely straight line), Sporcle geography games, and Geoguessr.

I always looked forward to watching his Geoguessr videos (although nowadays am just as attracted to his real-world missions) -- this was the height of the pandemic in 2020 and I had nothing better to do than sit and watch -- and eventually I bit the bullet and paid for my own subscription to the game (about $30/year -- don't know why I waited so long, really).

For those who don't know, Geoguessr is a browser-based game in which users are placed at a random spot in the world and they have to figure out where they are using Google Streetview imagery. Some go for speed, some go for accuracy, but I like it mostly because I get to explore different parts of the world which I may or may not ever see otherwise!
