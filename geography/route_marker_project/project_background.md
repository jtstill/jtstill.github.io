<h3 class="archive__subtitle">Our First Road Trip</h3>
In the summer of 2022, Lyndsey and I took a 3,400-mile road trip. We had never taken a trip together more than a few days or out of state (besides her coming down to spend a week with me in Baltimore the previous summer, when I did research for Loyola), so we figured that this would be the perfect opportunity to spend some time together and see some really cool sights – while I had been west a few times to visit my grandparents, she had never stepped foot past the Mississippi! I was almost more excited to watch her see the dramatic landscapes of the western US for the first time than I was to see them myself.

Due to several circumstances, it just so happened to work out for me to buy a car out in Phoenix while visiting family and drive it back home to PA, so Lyndsey and I decided to capitalize on the opportunity and see as many things as we could. The plan was as follows: we'd drive north from Phoenix to Sedona, onward to the Grand Canyon and Page, and make a quick stop at Four Corners before touring the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde in Colorado. From there, we'd head northwest to Arches National Park in Utah and then begin the long, scenic route through the mountains of Colorado before making a beeline home to south-central Pennsylvania through the Midwest. We'd stop in my Papa’s hometown of Mt. Zion, in rural Illinois, to pay my respects to the family and nurse my need for nostalgia.

<h4 class="archive__subtitle">A Rough Plan</h4>
I’ve always been a geography lover, having a soft spot in my heart for (what I deem) cool things such as old globes depicting now dissolved or renamed nations, things such as the US Interstate system and watching the counties fill in with blue or red on election nights (games such as Geoguessr and websites like Sporcle cemented this strange fascination). I don’t know, maybe it’s that combination of wanderlust and that number, structure-oriented side of my brain that makes world borders and other travel-related systems so interesting to me. Anyways.

On our trip, Lyndsey was kind enough to make stops for me to take pictures next to state highway signs, which I thought was cool because most of them have their own distinct style (save for those with no creativity – I’m looking at you, Kentucky. Mississippi. Iowa. New Jersey). Arizona and Missouri feature their state outlines. Kansas uses a sunflower. Colorado’s sports the state flag. As a collector of various things, I thought it would be cool to start a new collection. Because most highway signs are unique, it was a also a cool way to prove I’d been there. Now, it’s a bit difficult to take the signs themselves with me – not to mention illegal! – so the pictures would have to do. But I wanted to get a picture with one in each of the 50 states; I’ve always wanted to go to all 50 someday anyways, so this could be proof! 

By about the time we hit Kansas or Missouri, though, I had conceived a more specific goal: what if I could not only get a picture of me with each of the 50 state signs, but also have those signs number 1 to 50 – no number or state repeats? That way I could a) clearly order them, b) have it look pretty neat displayed somewhere, and c) have a bit of an added challenge: it might force me to stray a bit off the touristy path and see a lesser-known America.

Looking into this once we got home, I realized it might be a bit more of a challenge than I thought. First of all, not every state has a lot of choice on which number I could get. While states like Pennsylvania or New York have lots to choose from between 1 and 50, Arizona’s only sub-50 highway is a small stretch of pavement east of Phoenix: AZ 24. So not only did I have to get 24 in Arizona (meaning to get a 24 in any other state was completely pointless), but I also had to actually go to that spot to get it, which brought in another dilemma: even if I could get a number in state X, was it worth it? While I do want to see as much of the country as I can, I gotta have some reason to go other than to take a picture with a road sign (lame!). So that limits my possibilities a bit. It’s not worth driving hundreds of miles to find a ten-mile stretch of road that constitutes Wyoming 10 when Wyoming 22 is just a skip south of the Grand Tetons, something I might actually go and see one day. So, I had to take that into consideration. As a stats major with a bonus computer science minor, I was sure I could automate some way to figure out, if not the ideal combination, then at least some of the possible solutions to my problem.
