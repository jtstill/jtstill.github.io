<h3 class="archive__subtitle">The Improved Code</h3>
I started with an outline that I found online, i.e. sample code for the N-Queens problem. Along with having to modify the violation parameters (as mentioned before, diagonals are irrelevant, but "existing" spots matter), I also had to make sure I read in the file with the possibilities for each state and build what I called my "reference board" – the two-dimensional array that I would use to check whether a highway existed in a certain state. After some careful thought, I was also able to visually produce this board, with 1’s representing valid spaces and 0’s representing non-existent/non-doable choices (colored green and red in the output for convenience). From here, I could modify the N-Queens algorithm to look for my solutions.

With a few slight hiccups taken care of, my algorithm was finally working on the small dataset from the example on the previous page. When I expanded my search to the full 50 states, however, I ran into a few other problems. First, it wasn’t getting past row 25 or so, popping between 19-22 repeatedly, almost as if in a loop. I quickly realized the problem: I had it set up so that states made up the columns and highway numbers made up the rows. So, even though I had the states organized in the dictionary from least choice to most choice (states like Arizona, with only route 24, were on the left, and states like Pennsylvania, which is relatively free choice since I live there, were on the right), it was getting bogged down at the end of every row. To fix this, I transposed my reference board such that states were now the rows and state highway numbers the columns. 

My improved reference board with feasibly photographed/travelled state routes (or those I've already done) marked as a green "1":

As a result, the algorithm would in theory quickly get through the first rows like Arizona and Nevada, having only one choice each, and spend more time only toward the end when it ran into high-choice states like Pennsylvania. This nearly guarantees never having to return all the way to early rows. This made for another interesting dilemma...

<h3 class="archive__subtitle">Expanding the Search</h3>

When I calculated the number of possible combinations of state-number pairs based on only the feasible ones, I ended up with something like 10^23 solutions. As it turns out, the dependencies (such as not being able to pick a number again once it’s already been used) make a significant difference! I only got about halfway through the full 50-state run through of my program until there were quite literally no solutions to my problem.

In my efforts to be both A) realistic about how far I’d go out of my way to get a picture with a silly little highway sign and B) aware of conserving computer power/time, I’d inadvertently narrowed down my choices too far. By the time I got to Florida, all the signs I’d flagged as “possible” had been eaten up in some combination or another by the previous states. I had to expand my search a bit.

Little by little, I widened my search, considering places a bit further off the touristy track in the states where either the algorithm was getting stuck or where I thought I might be more likely to travel (whether someplace big with lots of attractions like California or somewhere close such as Delaware or Ohio). It took a lot of fiddling, but eventually I broke through. The first time a solution popped into view, 13 others showed up with it! Below is a view of what a solution looks like:
 
As you can see, there is one X in every row and one X in every column, with no overlap whatsoever. Every number has its unique place in every state!

In list format (also generated by my program for each solution), the solution above looks like:
```
['AZ 24', 'CO 9' , 'KS 27', 'MD 42', 'MO 19', 'NV 28', 'WV 43', 'WY 22', 'AK 1' , 'AR 50',
 'HI 11', 'IL 48', 'IN 38', 'MA 6' , 'MT 40', 'NE 31', 'NH 16', 'NJ 37', 'ND 15', 'OK 3' , 
 'SD 44', 'WI 21', 'ID 33', 'IA 13', 'KY 36', 'LA 46', 'MS 18', 'TN 14', 'VT 30', 'AL 17',
 'NM 47', 'NY 39', 'NC 49', 'RI 10', 'TX 5' , 'VA 8' , 'ME 4' , 'CT 32', 'FL 26', 'OH 41',
 'WA 7' , 'MI 25', 'MN 29', 'OR 34', 'UT 12', 'DE 2' , 'SC 35', 'CA 45', 'GA 20', 'PA 23']
```

In all (at least for this run through, which found 14 total solutions), the entire process took less than a minute to run, is completely automatic given a correctly formatted text file -- each line is of the form “[state]: [comma-separated numbers]” and lines generally run shortest to longest. For my purposes, it even looked pretty enough! A problem that started as a theoretical stab in the dark actually manifested as a practical solution-finding program, and hopefully it'll act as an easy tool moving forward that I can use to plan out my side trips and test if getting the next picture is worth it!
