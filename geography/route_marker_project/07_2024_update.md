<h3 class="archive__subtitle">A July 2024 Update</h3>

It’s been nearly two years since that word-vomit of a project narrative, but I’m still plugging away at it. Reading the math/coding approach back, I’m impressed that I was able to figure that out, given that I most certainly would not be able to now. Since graduating, algorithm-based coding like that has slipped to the wayside in favor of my job’s duties, which is mostly centered on SQL code and Power BI visualizations. I’m still committed to completing the project, and to date I have amassed pictures in 20 states. A few of them aren’t below the number 50 and a few others overlap and/or won’t be usable in some other way, but I’m making good progress!

Since I wrote the first part of this, some new constraints have come up and some others have loosened. Some of those “doable” signs I identified probably aren’t. Originally, I just looked on google maps near city centers where I figured I might someday visit (Dallas, San Francisco, etc). One thing that I didn’t really consider was pedestrian safety – I do not want to have to stop my car on a busy freeway to snap a picture and put either myself or Lyndsey in danger. There’s too much at stake there for so little gain. I went back and identified this issue as one of the challenges in my [project background](/geography/route_marker_project/project_background).

Second, I want good pictures. If I can help it, a picturesque background or some display of the state’s beauty is going to look a heck of a lot better hanging on a wall someday, and so I’m expanding my search to a lot more areas (think: the places between the locations I want to see). The picture on the right looks a whole lot better than the one on the left:

I also discovered two websites that make tracking my travels easy, and they tell me both where I’ve been and how much I have yet to see:

| Site | Personal Page |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| [Travel Mapping - Highways](https://travelmapping.net/?units=miles&u=jtstill&) | [jtstill](/geography/travelmapping/travelmapping) |
| [Mob-Rule.com](https://www.mob-rule.com/home) | [jtstill](/geography/mobrule/mobrule) |

I’ve tracked over 10,000 miles of unique road designations driven and about 350 counties visited since 2022 – hopefully more to come! Lyndsey and I are getting married in November and subsequently honeymooning in Hawaii, which will add more to each of those numbers, since we plan to see as much as possible while there. Life is good! One day I hope to post all of this somewhere.
