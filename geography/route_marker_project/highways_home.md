<h3 class="archive__subtitle">What Is This Project? A Brief History</h3>
Some people want to be able to say they've travelled to all fifty US states. Here, I take that one step further, as I attempt to get a picture with every state's route marker -- the full 1 to 50 -- no skips or repeats! This project is a fun way for me to see all fifty, get off the beaten path, and have irrefutable picture evidence of the ordeal! Plus, I think it'll look pretty cool hanging on a wall once I've completed the set!
